# SoftUni_Test_Repo
This repository is created with the sole purpose of completing the assigned Git and GitHub exercises.
This repository is also updated with TortoiseGit.
I have also tested switching branches functionality in TortoiseGit.
Changes made to README.md are made via master branch and "develop" branch.
Afterwards, I will most likely delete this repository.
