# SoftUni_Test_Repo
This repository is created with the sole purpose of completing the assigned Git and GitHub exercises.
This repository is also updated with TortoiseGit.
I have also tested switching branches functionality in TortoiseGit.
Changes made to README.md are made via master branch and "develop" branch.
Changes made to README.md are made using GitBash program as well.
File is edited in GitHub also for the purposes of creating a conflict and then testing conflict resolution using GitBash.
Afterwards, I will most likely delete this repository.
